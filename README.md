This Air BnB Console works through a command line interpreter through the console file. It works by pulling data from the file storage system and allows the user to save and store relevant data.
Below is a brief description of each file and its function to provide a working console.

<br>

### 🌟 [Console](https://github.com/Ace-Quantum/atlas-AirBnB_clone/blob/main/console.py)
- Console with command line
- boop
<details>
<summary>Function Details</summary>
<ul><li>This does things</li></ul></details>

### 🌟 [Models](https://github.com/Ace-Quantum/atlas-AirBnB_clone/tree/main/models)
- The model file contains many functions that support the console's functionality.
- Some of these are support classes such as the user, city, place, state, amenity, and review classes.
- Others such as the Base Model are the starting point for all other classes to function from.
